## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Android device or emulator (API 24+)
- ADB installed and device connected
- Enable "Developer options" and "USB debugging"

### Step 1: Build the Application
```bash
cd "/home/siva/Projects/Local TTS/Kitten TTS/NekoTTS"
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### Step 2: Install on Device
```bash
# Install the APK
./gradlew installDebug

# Or manually install if needed
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Step 3: Configure Android TTS Settings
1. Open device **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Accessibility** ‚Üí **Text-to-speech output**
3. Select **"Neko Text-to-Speech"** as preferred engine
4. Test with the **"Listen to an example"** button
5. You should hear synthetic audio (since real models aren't included)

### Step 4: Test System Integration

**Test with Moon Reader (Primary Use Case):**
1. Install Moon Reader from Play Store
2. Open any book/text file
3. Select text and choose **"Read Aloud"** or use TTS button
4. Verify Neko TTS is used and audio plays

**Test "Read Aloud" Feature:**
1. Open any app with text (Chrome, Messages, etc.)
2. Select some text
3. Tap **"Read Aloud"** in the context menu
4. Should see floating "Reading with Neko TTS..." dialog
5. Audio should play through device speakers

**Test Google Assistant Integration:**
1. Ask Google Assistant to read something
2. Should use your selected Neko TTS engine

### Step 5: Monitor Logs
```bash
# Monitor TTS activity
adb logcat | grep -i "NekoTTS\|ProcessText\|TextToSpeech"

# Filter for errors only
adb logcat | grep -E "(ERROR|FATAL).*Neko"
```

### Step 6: Test Voice Selection
1. Open the Neko TTS app
2. Navigate to voice selection
3. Try different voices (Kokoro/Kitten)
4. Test different languages
5. Adjust speed/pitch settings
6. Preview voices with sample text

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ What Should Work:
- **System TTS Integration**: Any app requesting TTS should work
- **Voice Synthesis**: Audio generation (synthetic fallback when models absent)
- **Language Support**: All 80+ languages should be available
- **Settings Persistence**: Voice/speed/pitch settings should save
- **"Read Aloud"**: Text selection context menu should work
- **Session Management**: Multiple TTS requests should be handled properly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations:
- **Model Files**: Real ONNX models not included (using synthetic audio fallback)
- **Voice Quality**: Synthetic audio is basic formant synthesis
- **Performance**: Real models would provide much better quality

### üîß Adding Real Models (Optional):
To use real ONNX models instead of synthetic audio:

1. **Add model files to assets:**
   ```
   app/src/main/assets/models/kokoro-v1.0.onnx        (310MB)
   app/src/main/assets/models/kitten_tts_nano_v0_1.onnx  (25MB)
   app/src/main/assets/voices/voices.bin                (voice embeddings)
   ```

2. **Rebuild and reinstall:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean assembleDebug
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Install
```bash
# Uninstall previous version
adb uninstall com.nekotts.app

# Clear gradle cache and rebuild
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew installDebug
```

### TTS Not Working
1. Check if Neko TTS is selected in Android TTS settings
2. Restart the device after changing TTS engine
3. Check logcat for initialization errors
4. Try clearing app data: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Neko TTS ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear Data

### "Read Aloud" Not Appearing
1. Verify `ProcessTextActivity` is registered in manifest
2. Check if text selection includes the "Read Aloud" option
3. Some apps may not support `ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT`

### No Audio Output
1. Check device volume levels
2. Test with other TTS engines to verify audio works
3. Check logcat for audio playback errors
4. Verify AudioTrack initialization in logs

### Performance Issues
1. Monitor memory usage: `adb shell dumpsys meminfo com.nekotts.app`
2. Check CPU usage during synthesis
3. Real ONNX models will be more CPU intensive than synthetic fallback
